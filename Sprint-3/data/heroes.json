And as Starlight, “The Defender of Des Moines,” all she’s ever wanted to do is save the world — and while a lot of people say that as a corny catchphrase, she actually means it. So when she’s selected to join The Seven, it’s every dream she’s ever had come true.","image":"/images/starlight.png"},{"id":5,"alias":"Queen-Meave","name":"Margaret","powers":"Superhuman strength, Superhuman speed, Superhuman ability, Superhuman durability, Superhuman jump","review":"As a warrior, a feminist, a humanitarian, and second most powerful member of The Seven, Queen Maeve is the ultimate role model for little girls all over the world.

His attractive features have made him Vought’s social media propaganda. Unfortunately, that’s pretty much all the company wants from him — because he’s The Seven’s token aquatic Superhero. But he knows he could be doing so much more than flashing his biceps on Instagram if only they’d let him... even though he’s secretly proud that his profile gets 4 million hits a day.","image":"/images/the-deep.png"},{"id":8,"alias":"Translucent","name":"Unknown","powers":"Superhuman strength, carbon skin, invisibility","review":"Translucent is The Seven’s invisible superhero, thanks to his carbon metamaterial skin that bends light and makes him bulletproof.
